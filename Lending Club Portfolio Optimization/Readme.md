  This filefold contains one of my course projects using Python.
  
  In this project, we use LGBM model to predict the risk of borrowers, and then build an optimization model for the investors to build their own ideal loading portfolio which tries to maximize return rate and minimize potential risk.
  
  The content of our project is as followed:
  1. Project Goal
  2. Lending Club Company
  3. Data Interpretation
  4. Prediction Model
  5. Optimization Model
  6. Conclusion
